# devops-task-terraform-docker
This project is part of a DevOps Internship program provided by Elevate Labs. The task focuses on understanding and implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision a local Docker container. You will learn how to automate container creation and management, which is an essential skill for modern DevOps and cloud engineers.

The main goal is to get hands-on experience with Terraform syntax, provider usage (Docker in this case), state files, and command-line operations such as init, plan, apply, and destroy. By the end of this task, youâ€™ll gain a deeper understanding of how Terraform manages infrastructure in a declarative and version-controlled way.
